# ridesharing
Very briefly: an analysis on the dynamics between supply and demand in a ridesharing company context.

In this repository you'll find:
- A jupyter file, in which you can find some python code necessary for the analysis
- A pdf file, in which I summarized the main results of the analysis

Of course, you can take a look on the python code, but it's still quite messy, I need to review it. Promise, I'll eventually do it. 
If you're interested only in the main ideas of the project, well, you can just take a look on the pdf. In particular the main insights are condensed in the first pages, in which I tried to build a simple mathematical model behind the dynamic supply and demand.


The model could be improved in many ways. For example, the first thing to be improved, is that we could extend the second equation by adding a noise factor, which would explain the volatility component of the relationship between the two members of the equation. I'm still not sure if this could lead to anything interesting, but I'm going to think about it.
